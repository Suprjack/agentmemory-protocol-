## 🎯 YOUR WORK (3 Options)

### OPTION A: Google Slides (Recommended - Best Quality)

**Time:** 2-3 hours

**Steps:**
1. **Open:** https://slides.google.com
2. **Create:** New Presentation → "Pitch" template
3. **Build 25 slides:** Use `pitch-slides.md` as guide
   - Copy text slide by slide
   - Insert `01-program-account.jpg` on Slide 4
   - Insert `02-transaction-history.jpg` on Slide 5
   - Insert logo on Slide 1
   - For agent stats: Screenshot `agent-viewer.html` in browser
4. **Voiceover:** https://elevenlabs.io (free 10K chars)
   - Copy script from `DEMO-PITCH-DECK.md`
   - Voice: "Adam" or "Antoni"
   - Download MP3
5. **Combine:** https://kapwing.com
   - Upload slides (export as images first)
   - Upload voiceover MP3
   - Sync timing
   - Export MP4 (1080p)
6. **Upload:** YouTube (unlisted)

### OPTION B: Marp CLI (Fastest - Auto-Generate)

**Time:** 30 minutes

**Steps:**
1. **Install Marp:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @marp-team/marp-cli
   ```

2. **Generate PDF:**
   ```bash
   cd agentmemory-protocol/demo
   marp pitch-slides.md --pdf --allow-local-files
   ```

3. **Result:** `pitch-slides.pdf` ready for submission

**Note:** This skips video, submits PDF instead (acceptable for hackathon)

---

### OPTION C: Manual Screenshots + PowerPoint

**Time:** 3-4 hours (most control)

**Steps:**
1. Take 3 more screenshots manually:
   - Open `agent-viewer.html` in browser → screenshot
   - Visit decision log URL → screenshot
   - Visit purchase URL → screenshot

2. Build in PowerPoint/Keynote:
   - Use `SLIDE-BUILDER-INSTRUCTIONS.md` as guide
   - Insert all 6 screenshots
   - Add text from `pitch-slides.md`

3. Export as video (PowerPoint: File → Export → Video)

## 🎤 VOICEOVER SCRIPT (If Using Video)

**Source:** `DEMO-PITCH-DECK.md` (voiceover sections)

**Quick Extract (First 3 slides):**

```
Slide 1:
"AgentMemory Protocol. Trust infrastructure for AI agents on Solana. 
Deployed and working with 11 live transactions."

Slide 2:
"AI agents make thousands of decisions daily. But how do you trust them? 
Traditional agents ask you to trust blindly. AgentMemory agents provide 
cryptographic proof."

Slide 3:
"AgentMemory has three core pillars: Decision logging for accountability. 
Reputation tracking for trust. And a memory marketplace for the agent economy."

[... continue for all 25 slides]
```

**Full script:** 4,000 characters (fits ElevenLabs free tier)
