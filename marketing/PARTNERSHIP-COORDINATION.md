## 🎯 PARTNER-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

### 1. AgentDEX (Trading Focus)

**Value Prop:**
"Trading agents need reputation. AgentMemory logs every trade, calculates win rates, creates verifiable attestations."

**Launch Angle:**
- Integration: Trading memory module (logs trades, tracks performance)
- Use case: "Agent with 73% win rate can prove it on-chain"
- CTA: "Try AgentDEX + AgentMemory for trust-based trading"

**Coordination:**
- Tag them in Twitter thread: "Special shoutout to @AgentDEX for trading memory integration"
- Mention in forum post: "Integrated with AgentDEX for reputation tracking"
- Offer: Write joint case study ("How AgentDEX + AgentMemory Build Trust")

---

### 2. SAID (Identity Focus)

**Value Prop:**
"Identity verification is meaningless without verifiable history. AgentMemory proves 'this agent DID this work'."

**Launch Angle:**
- Integration: Identity attestation (link agent ID to memory)
- Use case: "Prove authorship of decisions"
- CTA: "Combine SAID identity with AgentMemory reputation"

**Coordination:**
- Tag in Twitter: "@SAID integration ensures memory authenticity"
- Mention in forum: "SAID verifies agent identity, AgentMemory verifies agent actions"
- Offer: Cross-promote (we mention SAID, they mention us)

---

### 3. Solder-Cortex (Compliance Focus)

**Value Prop:**
"Regulatory compliance requires audit trails. AgentMemory provides immutable, timestamped decision logs."

**Launch Angle:**
- Integration: Compliance module (logs decisions with reasoning)
- Use case: "Agents can pass audits with on-chain proof"
- CTA: "Enterprise-ready memory with Solder-Cortex"

**Coordination:**
- Tag in Twitter: "@SolderCortex partnership for compliance-ready agents"
- Mention in forum: "Built with enterprise agents in mind (Solder-Cortex integration)"
- Offer: Co-write compliance whitepaper

---

### 4. ZK Compression (Privacy Focus)

**Value Prop:**
"Memory doesn't have to be public. ZK compression = private, verifiable logs."

**Launch Angle:**
- Integration: Privacy-preserving memory (compressed proofs)
- Use case: "Log decisions without revealing sensitive data"
- CTA: "Private memory with ZK Compression"

**Coordination:**
- Tag in Twitter: "@ZKCompression enables private memory on Solana"
- Mention in forum: "Privacy-first agents can use ZK-compressed logs"
- Offer: Technical blog post (how it works)

---

### 5. Money Machine (DeFi Focus)

**Value Prop:**
"DeFi agents need conviction tracking. AgentMemory logs holdings, rebalances, and portfolio composition over time."

**Launch Angle:**
- Integration: Wallet conviction module (track portfolio over time)
- Use case: "Prove diamond hands or strategic rebalancing"
- CTA: "DeFi + AgentMemory = verifiable conviction"

**Coordination:**
- Tag in Twitter: "@MoneyMachine integration for DeFi reputation"
- Mention in forum: "DeFi agents can track wallet conviction on-chain"
- Offer: Joint demo (live portfolio tracking)

---

### 6. Identity (Profile Focus)

**Value Prop:**
"Agent profiles need history. AgentMemory = portable reputation across platforms."

**Launch Angle:**
- Integration: Profile enrichment (link memory to identity)
- Use case: "Your agent's portfolio follows them everywhere"
- CTA: "Build richer agent profiles with AgentMemory"

**Coordination:**
- Tag in Twitter: "Identity integration for cross-platform reputation"
- Mention in forum: "Agents can port their memory to any platform"

## 📊 PARTNER ENGAGEMENT METRICS

**Track for each partner:**
- [ ] DM response rate (did they reply?)
- [ ] Launch participation (RT, comment, mention?)
- [ ] Integration usage (GitHub views on their example)
- [ ] Feedback quality (suggestions, bugs, improvements)
- [ ] Post-launch engagement (stayed in touch?)

**Use to prioritize:**
- High engagement → Tier 2-4 perks
- Medium engagement → Tier 1 perks
- Low engagement → Thank + move on

---

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

**Risk:** Partner doesn't respond before launch

**Mitigation:**
- Still mention them (integration exists)
- Don't wait for approval (carte blanche mode)
- Tag them anyway (worst case: they ignore)
- Move on (focus on engaged partners)

**Risk:** Partner criticizes integration publicly

**Mitigation:**
- Respond quickly (within 6h)
- Fix if valid (technical issue)
- Clarify if misunderstanding (documentation)
- Remove integration if requested (respect their brand)

**Risk:** Partner launches competing product

**Mitigation:**
- Collaboration > competition (offer co-development)
- Differentiate (our unique value prop)
- Learn from them (improve our offering)
- Stay friendly (agent ecosystem is small)
